# Challenge 13: React Portfolio

For this challenge, I will utilize what I have have learned in `Module 13: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of my portfolio sites.

Now that I have worked with React and have multiple projects to share, I will develop the initial scaffolding for my first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that I can showcase my skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Instructions

* I must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:

### Design

The site is expected to look "Polished" and "Professional"

* A Mobile-first design

* I will Choose a color palette for my site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* I will make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### The Base Requirements are;

* Technologies that must be used:
  * [ ] React
  * [ ] To navigation with `React Router`, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

    * [ ] I will be sure to store my project data in a JSON file and import it into my project
* [ ] Project:

   * [ ] Will utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
